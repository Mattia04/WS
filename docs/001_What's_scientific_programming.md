# What is Programming in Scientific Contexts?

## Historical Perspective of Scientific Computing

Programming in scientific contexts has played a transformative role in 
modern science. Its roots trace back to the mid-20th century, during the 
rapid development of early computing machines. One of the most notable 
milestones was the advent of [ENIAC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/476557)  
(1945), one of the first general-purpose electronic computers. ENIAC’s 
primary goal was to solve numerical problems, particularly for military 
applications such as calculating artillery trajectories for thermonuclear 
weapons. 
However, it quickly became evident that computers could serve a far broader purpose.

The development of programming languages tailored to scientific needs began 
in the 1950s, spearheaded by the creation of `Fortran` (_Formula 
Translation_). Fortran was, at the time, revolutionary: providing a way for 
scientists and engineers to write programs that closely mirrored the 
mathematical formulas they worked with daily. This innovation enabled 
researchers to shift from manual calculations to automated processes, 
solving problems of unprecedented complexity.

As computing power grew exponentially, so did the scope of scientific 
programming. The introduction of high-level languages, numerical libraries, 
and supercomputers allowed scientists to tackle vast problems, from 
modeling planetary systems to simulating nuclear reactions. 

## Key achievements of scientific programming

Today, scientific programming is at the heart of nearly every field of 
science and engineering. Here are some examples in various fields of science.

## Key Differences Between General and Scientific Programming

### Purpose

The fundamental goals of general and scientific programming differ significantly:

- **General Programming** focuses on creating software systems, applications, and 
tools designed for user interaction, entertainment, productivity, or commercial use. Examples include web applications, mobile apps, and games. The emphasis is often on usability, scalability, and user experience.
- **Scientific Programming** is primarily concerned with 
  solving computational problems specific to scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. The objective is to model, simulate, or analyze phenomena, often pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the natural world.

For instance, while a general programmer might build a user-friendly photo-sharing app, a scientific programmer might simulate the trajectory of a spacecraft or analyze genome sequences to identify mutations.

### Algorithm Design

Scientific programming demands the creation or implementation of algorithms tailored to specific scientific problems such as:

- Differential Equations: Modeling phenomena such as heat transfer, orbital mechanics, or population dynamics.
- Optimization: Solving problems like minimizing energy states in physical systems or training machine learning models.
- Statistical Analysis: Processing and interpreting experimental data.

In contrast, general programming algorithms often deal with functionality like search, sorting, data structure manipulation, or ensuring the responsiveness of applications.

### Testing and Validation

Scientific programming requires rigorous testing to ensure results align with theoretical predictions or empirical data.

In general programming, testing primarily ensures software functionality and user experience.

### Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific programming:

- Version Control: Tools like Git are essential for tracking changes and collaborating on research projects.
- Open-Source Practices: Sharing code, data, and methodologies to ensure other researchers can verify or build upon work.
- Containerization: Docker and similar tools are increasingly used to create reproducible computational environments.

While reproducibility is also important in general programming (e.g., version control in development), the emphasis is more on iterative improvements and deployment.

### Lifecycles and Longevity

Scientific programs often have long lifespans, requiring maintainability for decades:

- Legacy systems, like Fortran codes written in the 1970s, are still widely used in fields like weather prediction and computational physics.
- Scientific programs may be iteratively improved but often focus on stability and correctness over frequent feature updates.

General programming often has shorter lifecycles, particularly for commercial applications, which are regularly replaced or rewritten to meet changing user demands.

### Community and Collaboration

- Scientific Programming: Collaboration across disciplines is common. Physicists, chemists, and engineers often work together, sharing domain knowledge to achieve complex goals.
- General Programming: Collaboration typically focuses on team-based software development, involving designers, developers, and business analysts.

### Ethical Considerations

Scientific programming often involves addressing global challenges, such as climate change or public health, which carry profound ethical implications:
- Ensuring accurate and unbiased simulations for policymaking.
- Avoiding misuse of scientific models, such as weaponizing computational advances. (I'm looking at you engeneer who accepted that job to build missiles)

In general programming, ethical considerations often focus on user privacy, data security, and fair algorithms for public-facing applications.

### Learning Curves and Background Knowledge

- Scientific programming often requires more understanding of the underlying mathematical and physical principles than the programming skills itself.
- General programming typically emphasizes mastery of software development practices, user interfaces, and system design, which may not require domain-specific knowledge.
