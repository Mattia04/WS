# What is Programming in Scientific Contexts?

## Historical Perspective of Scientific Computing

Programming in scientific contexts has its roots in the early development of computers. Machines like ENIAC (1940s) were initially created for solving numerical problems such as ballistics trajectories. Early programming efforts in scientific computing revolved around efficient solutions for complex mathematical problems, utilizing languages like Fortran (developed in the 1950s). This marked the beginning of algorithmic thinking in science, enabling researchers to simulate and predict physical phenomena computationally.

Over time, the field evolved, with advancements in computational power, numerical algorithms, and the development of specialized programming languages. Today, scientific programming underpins fields such as astrophysics, climate modeling, and quantum computing.

## Key Differences Between General and Scientific Programming

	•	Purpose: General programming focuses on building software systems, apps, or games, while scientific programming is dedicated to solving computational problems in fields like physics, chemistry, and biology.
	•	Precision and Performance: Scientific programs prioritize numerical precision and computational efficiency, often involving floating-point calculations and large datasets.
	•	Tooling: Scientific programming extensively uses libraries like NumPy (Python) or BLAS (C++) for numerical tasks, and tools such as MATLAB for analysis and visualization.
	•	Algorithm Design: Emphasis is on implementing algorithms that solve domain-specific problems like differential equations, optimization, or data fitting.
