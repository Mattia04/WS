# How to Approach This Guide

## Balancing Theory with Practice

This guide is taught to give you the concepts and tools to solve real 
science problems through the guide. In this way you can learn the concepts 
and get experience at the same time.

## Suggested Progression Through the Guide

My suggestion is to learn following the table of contents, but if you have 
some experience you can start where you want, or you can read only the 
theoretical part of the guide.
